"""Module, which provides some roles and models to support coalition creation with mango.

There are mainly two roles involved in this:
* :class:`CoalitionInitiatorRole`: Initiates a coalition, therfore sends the invites, receives the
                                   responses and informs all participants, which accepted, about the
                                   coalition and its topology
* :class:`CoalitionParticipantRole`: Participates in a coalition, the main responsibility is
                                     answering the coalition invite and storing the
                                     coalition-assignment when a coalition creation was successful

The messages defined in this module:
* :class:`CoalitionAssignment`: sent by the initiator when the accepted coalition really got created
* :class:`CoalitionInvite`: sent by the initiator to start the coalition creation
* :class:`CoaltitionResponse`: sent by any participant as answer to an CoalitionInvite

The role models defined in this module:
* :class:`CoalitionModel`: contains all information for all coalitions an agent participates in
